# Template for creating a user story

As a `<type of user>`, I want `<some goal>` so that `<some reason>`

Some examples:

* As a Practitioner, I want my profile page to include additional details about me (i.e., some of the answers to my Practitioner application) so that I can showcase my experience.

* As a site member, I want to fill out an application to become a Certified Scrum Trainer so that I can teach CSM and CSPO courses and certify others.

* As a site visitor, I want to read current news on the home page so that I stay uptodate on current affairs.

* As a site admin, I want to delete any course or event, so I can remove things that will no longer occur.
